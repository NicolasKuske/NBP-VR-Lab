This is just a rough collection of thoughts. Please feel free to add anything or rearrange the points in a way that you can best work with it.
### 1. Upload files
- pointing task
- absolute orientation
- relative orientation
### 2. Fix Bugs
- [ ] Program the absolute task using the randomisation scheme that Peter introduced.  Right now, wrong arrows are included by hand and only include every second bin so that information on the other bins is lacking. The screenshots are hardcoded.

- [ ] Program the relative and pointing task using the new randomisation scheme. 

- [ ] In the relative task and the pointing task the performance for 0° is unexplainable high.

- [ ] In the relative task data for the 30° bin are missing.

- [ ] Colours of the buttons on the control pad and in the response training giving feedback after a trial are the same. This is confusing because the meaning does not match. Raul is going to change the colours on the control pad to colours that do not occur in the response training.


### 3. Implement infinite time condition & pre test

### 4. Combine code into one executable program (GUI?)
